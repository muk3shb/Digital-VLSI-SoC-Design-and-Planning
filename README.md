The field that we are talking about is inside this chip.
Now, If we look inside the chip we see the block Diagram

The block diagram highliths the center of board, which is the processor and along with processor we have various blocks, such as
  1. VCC/GND -  For power supply
  2. ADC
  3. I2C
  4. QSPI1 - Flash
  5. JTAG- UART.

we have SDRAM chip which is external chip, not On chip
